## Setting up Authentication

When you connect to edgeserver for the first time you will need to walk through the [#bootstrapping] process (dont worry this is easy).
This should get you setup with an admin account on the instance.

If you have a user account on an instance see the [Team Keys]() or [Site Keys]() endpoints and menus (in the UI) to get yourself setup with a key.
